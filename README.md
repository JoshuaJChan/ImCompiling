# ImCompiling
This project was inspired by long compilation times. The main idea is that after the compiler finishes, a sound effect will tell you that it's finished.

## How to use
* Install the latest python, eg) python3
* python's default modules should be enough to run the file
* Follow the inputs in the dialog box that opens up when the file runs
